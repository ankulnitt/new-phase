	full development story
	
Angular CLI
	must have node.js installed
	 -g says global
	npm install -g @angular/cli
	
	
	*app is root folder for application
	
	main.ts file - tilescript
	is the main file used for bottstrapping application
	
	polyfills.ts - used to support for unsupported browser
	
	karma.conf.js - 
	
	package.json is always entry point
	
	ts.lint.json - 
	
	
	bootstrapping process:
	
	index.html 
		<app-root> tag
		
		go to app.components.ts 
			see selector - app-root
	ng service to start application
	
	
	'ng lint' - gives all the linting error
